This code was used towards a paper outlining an 'Sensing and IoT' project coursework. 

## The Study 

Currently IoT is opening up new avenues for design and engineering, allowing us to create novel services that can allow the user to access a vast amount of data in form of actionable feedback . Personalised Healthcare, wearables, smart homes and personalised assistants are all topics driving the conversation . We are now seeing the personal tracking industry explore new ways to enhance health and wellbeing. This project aims to use your triathlon wearable data to inform best time of day to train â†’ tracking sleep, amount of calories burnt, weight married with environmental data to determine in a given day what the best time of day is best to workout with the aim to prototype a commercially scalable service solution.

Key Words: Machine Learning, Fitness, IoT, Wearble
